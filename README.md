Just some random project of doing a Discord bot using discord.py.  
Be sure to have Python 3.8 or higher installed (required by discord.py) !

Clone the projet and install the requirements :

```
git clone https://github.com/Zalk0/ChouetteBot-discord.git
cd ChouetteBot-discord
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---
Before launching the bot, you have to create the **`token_discord`** file and put a Discord bot token inside.  
It can be created and obtained in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers).

---
After having done all this you can launch the bot :

```
python main.py
```
